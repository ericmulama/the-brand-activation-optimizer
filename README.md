**Automated Geospatial Analytics for 360-Degree Brand Activations**
By Erick Mulama Shituku, 2025

## 📊 Project Impact
This project provides a full-scale analytical pipeline for a nationwide marketing campaign across all administrative districts in Tanzania. It bridges the gap between **Geospatial GIS data**, **Financial Auditing**, and **Marketing Strategy**.

## 🚀 Key Data Achievements (Based on Latest Run)
- **Nationwide Coverage:** Processed and visualized data for the entire Tanzania ADM2 dataset (184 districts).
- **Automated Financial Auditing:** Identified budget variances across the country, flagging districts exceeding the 15% risk threshold.
- **Strategic Quadrant Analysis:** Developed a classification system (Stars, Niches, Awareness, Optimization) to guide future marketing spend.
- **Geospatial Integration:** Successfully implemented the `pyogrio` engine for high-performance spatial joins between shapefiles and campaign CSVs.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains OCHA/HDX shapefiles and the generated `apex_horizon_marketing_data.csv`.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data generation and master analysis.
- `outputs/`: 
    - `Report_01`: Financial Audit (Budget vs. Actual).
    - `Report_02`: Marketing Funnel (CPE & Engagement %).
    - `Report_03-06`: Strategic Optimizers and Executive Summaries.
    - `Apex_Horizon_ROI_Map.png`: Nationwide performance heatmap.
    - `Strategic Memo.pdf`: finalized version of the memo with specific results.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** Data manipulation and financial logic.
- **GeoPandas & Pyogrio:** Spatial data processing.

- **Matplotlib:** Corporate-grade data visualization.

## Data Provenance
~ While this project uses simulated data for privacy reasons, the structure is designed to mimic real-world exports from SAP ERP systems and OCHA HDX geospatial repositories, ensuring the pipeline is production-ready. ~
